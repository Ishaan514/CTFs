# Off-base

## Challenge

"It seems my friend Rohan won't stop sending cryptic messages and he keeps mumbling something about base 64. Quick! We need to figure out what he is trying to say before he loses his mind...

bmFjdGZ7YV9jaDRuZzNfMGZfYmE1ZX0="

## Process

The message looks like it's in base64, and the challenge description implies it is in base 64. I converted the message bmFjdGZ7YV9jaDRuZzNfMGZfYmE1ZX0= from base64 to ASCII and got the flag.

The flag is nactf{a_ch4ng3_0f_ba5e}
