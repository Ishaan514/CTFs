# Least Significant Avenger

## Challenge

"I hate to say it but I think that Hawkeye is probably the Least Significant avenger. Can you find the flag hidden in this picture?"

You can download the problem file here [insignificant_hawkeye.png](insignificant_hawkeye.png)

## Process

The title implies that this is a Least Significant Bit, or LSB, encrypted image. I used https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/ to undo the LSB encryption.

The flag is nactf{h4wk3y3_15_th3_l34st_51gn1f1c4nt_b1t}
