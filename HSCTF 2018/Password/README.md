# Password

## Challenge

'Keith found a seemingly secret website somewhere on [BunSpace](http://206.189.179.133/secret1/), and he wants to find out the flag. However, since he is not an administrator, he doesn't know the password. Fortunately, he knows an administrator personally, and suspects that he was too lazy to use a secure password. Help him find the flag!'

## Process

I used inspect element to change my username to admin. I then guessed that the password might be password. It is simply password.

The flag is: flag{5f29a964dc0ec93054ab80ab7eef9ef7}
