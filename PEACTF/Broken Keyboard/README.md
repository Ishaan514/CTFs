# Broken Keyboard

## Challenge

Help! My keyboard only types numbers! [Ciphertext](enc.txt)

# Process

The ciphertext includes the following numbers.

```
112 101 97 67 84 70 123 52 115 99 49 49 105 115 99 48 48 108 125
```

It is only comprised of decimal numbers less than 128, so I guessed they were just decimal numbers which could be converted to ascii for the flag. I used this website to convert the ciphertext to the plaintext https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-hex-bin-dec-converter.html.

The flag is peaCTF{4sc11isc00l}
