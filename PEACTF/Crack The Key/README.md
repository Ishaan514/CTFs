# Crack The Key

## Challenge

"On one of my frequent walks through the woods, I stumbled upon this old French scroll with the title "le chiffre indéchiffrable." Remember to submit as peaCTF{plaintext_key}. [Ciphertext](enc.txt)"

## Process

I searched Google for "le chiffre indéchiffrable." and found out that this was the title of the Vigenère cipher.

I used the following website to get the ciphertext and the key https://www.mygeocachingprofile.com/codebreaker.vigenerecipher.aspx. I found out that the key was redpineapples. I then wrapped the key with flag format in order to get the flag.

The flag is peaCTF{redpineapples}
