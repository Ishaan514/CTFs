## Challenge

"The Federal CTF Inspector dropped by today looking for some hidden flags. He clearly needs to pursue a different career because we hid the flag right in plain sight."

## Process

I used ctrl-shift-i to open inspect element one the ctf site and found the flag. The title and the challenge description were both hinted to this.
