## Challenge

"My regular teacher was out sick so we had a **substitute** today. [Ciphertext](enc.txt)"

## Process

Emphasis on the word substitute implies that this problem is a substitution cipher problem. With the substituted alphabet, and the ciphered flag given in [enc.txt](enc.txt) we can find the flag.

```
Alphabet: â€‹WCGPSUHRAQYKFDLZOJNXMVEBTI
zswGXU{ljwdhsqmags}
```

I used this website to decipher the ciphertexthttps://www.dcode.fr/monoalphabetic-substitution. I then changed the capitalization and got the flag.

The flag is peaCTF{orangejuice}
